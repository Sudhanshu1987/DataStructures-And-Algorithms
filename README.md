# DataStructures-And-Algorithms
[Inspiration](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1003602/300-leetcode-problems-celebration/820387)- I do coding and datastructure and coding questions regularly but recently I have realized that I need an efficient mechanism to revise the algorithms/approaches and old questions. The objective of this file is to build a single place where I can create notes which I can use to revise and study material quickly and to develop common patterns/templates and approaches to solve the problems efficiently.
