# DataStructures-And-Algorithms
[Inspiration](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1003602/300-leetcode-problems-celebration/820387)- I do coding and datastructure and coding questions regularly but recently I have realized that I need an efficient mechanism to revise the algorithms/approaches and old questions. The objective of this file is to build a single place where I can create notes which I can use to revise and study material quickly and to develop common patterns/templates and approaches to solve the problems efficiently.

        The shortest path problem is about finding a path between  vertices in a graph such that the total sum of the edges weights is minimum.
        This problem could be solved easily using (BFS) if all edge weights were (), but here weights can take any value. Different algorithms are mentioned below depending on the         use-case.
